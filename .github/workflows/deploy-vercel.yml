# Optional: deploy to Vercel when pushing to main.
# The easiest way is to connect the repo in the Vercel dashboard (see DEPLOYMENT.md);
# then Vercel deploys automatically and you don't need this workflow.
#
# If you prefer to trigger deploys from GitHub Actions (e.g. with a Vercel token),
# you can adapt this workflow or use the "Deploy to Vercel" button in the repo.
